                    Over the past three years, large language models like ChatGPT have gone from curiosities
                    to everyday tools used on college campuses around the world. While some professors embrace them,
                    others ban them. Many institutions fall somewhere in between, setting vague policies or relying on
                    detection tools that have been proven ineffective in many instances. AI may be the most significant
                    innovation in education since the personal computer, and although this revolution has many different
                    characteristics, it echoes past battles over calculators and computers — battles that were
                    ultimately lost by those who tried to resist.

                    Technology doesn’t wait for policy, and as a current undergraduate student, I believe that the
                    sooner schools catch up, the better we can use these tools to improve learning rather than undermine
                    it. Still, an important question remains: Is it fair to compare AI with past innovations like
                    calculators and the early internet, or is this a fundamentally different challenge?

                    <br><br>
                    AI is not the first technology to disrupt higher education. In the 1970s, the pocket
                    calculator triggered a wave of backlash among educational institutions. Teachers warned that it
                    would weaken
                    students’ arithmetic skills, and some schools tried to ban calculators altogether. But others saw
                    the potential: If students no longer had to do long division by hand, they could focus on
                    bigger-picture math problems. Eventually, calculators became standard classroom tools, allowing
                    students to shift their focus from manual computation to understanding formulas and solving
                    higher-level, conceptual problems. Studies show that calculators can improve conceptual
                    understanding when used correctly.
                    <br><br>

                    This same cycle repeated in the 1990s with personal computers and the early internet. Critics feared
                    that spell-check and copy-paste would erode writing skills, and that search engines like Google and
                    communal encyclopedias like Wikipedia would replace real research. And yes, some students misused
                    those tools. But once schools embraced the technology and taught students how to use it well,
                    evaluate sources, and cite correctly, their academic work improved. Students were no longer limited
                    to the outdated books in their campus libraries, but suddenly had access to a multitude of books,
                    articles, and datasets in multiple languages, at any time.

                <aside class="inline-quote">But if personal computers were a bicycle for the mind, today’s AI tools are
                    more
                    like self-driving race cars: They don’t just help us think faster — they can take over the wheel
                    entirely.</aside>

                    The cycle of resistance and delayed acceptance is a recurring phenomenon in large institutions,
                    especially those with long-standing traditions in education, such as Columbia University. These
                    universities, responsible for the education of millions of Americans, cannot afford to change course
                    without serious caution. Even when faculty are eager to adapt, such as by updating policies on AI
                    use in student essays, their efforts are often delayed by the university’s complex bureaucracy and
                    layered approval processes. These systems are designed to ensure thoughtful decision-making, but
                    they can struggle to keep pace with rapid technological change. For example, a 2024 global survey
                    conducted by the Digital Education Council found that 86% of students already use AI in their
                    studies, underscoring the technology’s rapid and widespread adoption across disciplines.
                    <br><br>
                    Artificial intelligence is here to stay, and it will only grow more powerful with time. Detecting it
                    will become harder, its capabilities will expand, and its presence will become even more embedded in
                    student life. But this shouldn’t be seen as a threat or the end of education as we know it. We saw
                    how the rise of the internet brought about similar fears, yet it ultimately made learning richer and
                    more accessible. Resistance to change is part of human nature, and large institutions like
                    universities often move slowly. But whether they choose to lift AI restrictions or not, one thing is
                    clear: The current “in-between” approach is failing both students and faculty. It’s time for schools
                    to stop pretending this technology can be “defeated” and instead begin building an education system
                    that works with AI, not against it.
