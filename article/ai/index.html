      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the most transformative technological advancements in human history.
        It enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence — such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.
        Today, AI powers virtual assistants, self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rise of AI has redefined industries and sparked global debates about its impact on jobs, privacy, and society as a whole.
        As AI systems become more capable, understanding their role becomes essential for every individual and organization.

    <section id="impact">
      <h2>Impact of AI</h2>
      <p>
        AI is reshaping how people live and work. In healthcare, it assists doctors in diagnosing diseases faster and with greater accuracy.
        In education, it helps personalize learning experiences. In finance, AI systems detect fraud and predict market trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this technological revolution also introduces ethical and economic challenges — particularly concerning workforce displacement,
        privacy concerns, and bias in machine learning models.
